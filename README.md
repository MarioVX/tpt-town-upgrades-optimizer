script by MarioVX
Version 1.0

This script for the game "The Perfect Tower" calculates optimal Town Credits allocations
to maximize effective Town Credit income rate during your next Town Tier.
The only upgrades compared explicitly are those with inambiguously quantifiable benefit to TC income:
   * Conversion Rate from BPT to TC
   * Special Resource Drop Rate bonus per unspent TC
   * Statistics Bonus Increase.
The benefit of all other Town Upgrades depends on a fair amount of assumptions and can vary.
Therefore, the script also contains functions to check the opportunity cost of a different upgrade,
and allow the user to guess himself whether it is worth it or not.
For a specific benefit assumption, the script can also search for the TC amount at which this becomes worth it.
Special version for the Speed upgrades included so users don't have to bother with the benefit calculation.
